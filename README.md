# Study Royale — Web App (Vite + React + Tailwind)

This project is a small single-page web app designed for Ana's Study Royale game.
It includes:
- A StudyRoyale React component (src/components/StudyRoyaleApp.jsx)
- Daily reset logic based on Europe (resets elixir & deck at midnight)
- LocalStorage persistence
- Placeholders and instructions for Google Sheets and Notion integration
